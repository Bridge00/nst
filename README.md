# NST

This is an implementation of “Texture Networks: Feed-forward Synthesis of Textures and Stylized Images” by Ulyanov et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03417v1.pdf for my ECE 590: Computer Engineering Methods for Deep Learning final class project with Dr. Yiran Chen.

The final report is also in the repo to see our experiments. This was a partner project where my partner implemented a different NST paper. This repository only has the code for the paper I implemented.
